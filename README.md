This is a React app made from a React Course on Scrimba, which I linked [here.](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)

# Focus

It deals with a simple example of using 'props' in a project. 

# Issues 

The only issue I encountered was with having local images. 

Using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) I was able to figure out that I could put the 'images' folder inside the 'public' directory. 

Instead of having to 'import' every single image seperately, I was able to access it anywhere using '/images/example.png'

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
